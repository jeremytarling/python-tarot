            <h4>WTF?</h4>

            <p>This little website is a simple application written in Python to draw one or three randomly selected tarot cards from a dictionary of 78 descriptions and image references.  The <a href="https://github.com/jeremytarling/python-tarot">source code is here</a> - there are no license restrictions on the code, please feel free to fork or re-use.</p>

            <p>The card images are the late Jean-Claude Flornoy's lovely restoration of the tarot of <a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10537343h" target="new">Jean Dodal</a> - you can buy the deck from his website <a href="https://tarot-history.com/tarot-of-jean-dodal/" target="new">Tarot History</a>. They are used here with the kind permission of Roxanne Flornoy.</p>

            <p> The card interpretations are the work of the late <a href="http://www.cbdtarot.com/download/" target="_blank">Dr Yoav Ben Dov</a>, which he made available under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons by-nc-sa licence</a> - please be sure to link back to his website if you use them.</p>

            <p>As for me, my name is <a href="https://linktr.ee/jeremytarling">Jeremy Tarling</a> and I work as a metadata specialist at the BBC. I've been fascinated by the tarot since childhood when my aunty first introduced me to the cards.</p>
