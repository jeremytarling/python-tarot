    <h2>Welcome to the Tarot!</h2>

    <p>Having trouble making a decision? Worried about the future? Concerned that secret forces are controlling your destiny? Then it's time to consult the Tarot..</p>

	<hr />

    <h4>Think about your question and chose one or three cards:</h4>

    <p><strong><a href="/one-card">draw one random card</a></strong>
    <br />a word of advice in answer to your question</p>

    <p><strong><a href="/three-cards">draw three random cards</a></strong>
    <br />advice with more context - for example the past, present and future of the matter - or perhaps you, what opposes you, and how to overcome it</p>

    <p><strong><a href="/tarot-study">tarot study</a></strong>
        <br />the tarot is much more than a divinatory tool...</p>

    <h4>WTF?</h4>

    <p>This little website is a simple application written in Python to draw one or three randomly selected tarot cards from a dictionary of 78 descriptions and image references.  The <a href="https://github.com/jeremytarling/python-tarot">source code is here</a> - there are no license restrictions, please feel free to fork or re-use.</p>

    <p>The card images are the late Jean-Claude Flornoy's lovely restoration of the tarot of <a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10537343h" target="new">Jean Dodal</a> - you can get it from his website <a href="https://tarot-history.com/tarot-of-jean-dodal/" target="new">Tarot History</a>. They are used here with the kind permission of Roxanne Flornoy.</p>

    <p> The card interpretations are from the late Dr Yoav Ben Dov's excellent version of <a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10520316w/f131.item" target="_blank">Nicholas Conver's tarot de Marseille</a>, which he made available under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons by-nc-sa licence</a> - please be sure to link back to <a href="http://www.cbdtarot.com/download/" target="_blank">his website</a> if you use them.</p>

    <p>As for me, my name is <a href="https://linktr.ee/jeremytarling">Jeremy Tarling</a> and I work as a metadata specialist at the BBC. I've been fascinated by the tarot since childhood when my aunty first introduced me to the cards.</p>
