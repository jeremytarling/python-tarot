# python-tarot

This little website is a simple application written in Python to draw one or three randomly selected tarot cards from a dictionary of 78 descriptions and image references. The source code to this app is here - please feel free to fork or re-use, there are no license restrictions.

The tarot images and meanings are Yoav Ben Dov's excellent restoration of Nicholas Conver's deck from 1760. For further study of the images I suggest Jean-Claude Flornoy's restorations of the tarots of Jean Noblet or Jean Dodal.

As for me, my name is Jeremy Tarling and I work as a metadata specialist at the BBC. I've been fascinated by the tarot since childhood when my aunty first introduced me to the cards.
