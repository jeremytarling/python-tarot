[Welcome to the tarot!](https://python-tarot.herokuapp.com/)

This little website is a simple application written in Python to draw one or three randomly selected tarot cards from a dictionary of 78 descriptions and image references. There are no license restrictions on the code, please feel free to fork or re-use.

The card images are the late Jean-Claude Flornoy's lovely restoration of the tarot of Jean Dodal - you can the full deck from his website [Tarot History](https://tarot-history.com/). They are used here with the kind permission of Roxanne Flornoy.

The card interpretations are the work of the late Dr Yoav Ben Dov, which he made available under the Creative Commons by-nc-sa licence - please be sure to link back to [his website](http://www.cbdtarot.com/download/) if you use them.
