This little website is a simple application written in Python to draw one or three randomly selected tarot cards from a dictionary of 78 descriptions and image references. The source code is here - there are no license restrictions, please feel free to fork or re-use.

The card images are the late Jean-Claude Flornoy's lovely restoration of the tarot of Jean Dodal - you can get it from his website Tarot History. They are used here with the kind permission of Roxanne Flornoy.

The card interpretations are from the late Dr Yoav Ben Dov's excellent version of Nicholas Conver's tarot de Marseille, which he made available under the Creative Commons by-nc-sa licence - please be sure to link back to his website if you use them.

As for me, my name is Jeremy Tarling and I work as a metadata specialist at the BBC. I've been fascinated by the tarot since childhood when my aunty first introduced me to the cards.
