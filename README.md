# python-tarot

This little website is a simple application written in Python to draw one or three randomly selected tarot cards from a dictionary of 78 descriptions and image references. The app is deployed to Heroku here: https://python-tarot.herokuapp.com/.

My source code has no license restrictions, please feel free to fork or re-use. The tarot images and descriptions are Yoav Ben Dov's excellent restoration of Nicholas Conver's deck from 1760, which he kindly makes available under the Creative Commons by-nc-sa licence - please be sure to link to his site at https://cbdtarot.com/about/share-and-use/ if you use them.

As for me, my name is Jeremy Tarling and I work as a metadata specialist at the BBC. I've been fascinated by the tarot since childhood when my aunty first introduced me to the cards.
